This is the accompanying Eclipse M2E Plugin (M2E Connector) for my [Maven AAR Unpack Plugin](https://github.com/dbeaudoinfortin/MavenAARUnpackPlugin). The Maven AAR Unpack Plugin allows you to use Android Archive Library (AAR) files directly within your Maven Java project. Without this companion Eclipse plugin, you can still manually run Maven to compile your project, but Eclipse will always show build errors since it doesn't know how to add AAR dependencies to the project classpath.

You can manually download this plugin from the [releases section](https://github.com/dbeaudoinfortin/M2EMavenAARPlugin/releases). 

## How to install

This plugin is published on [Github Pages](https://dbeaudoinfortin.github.io/M2EMavenAARPlugin/), which is deployed directly from the [/docs](https://github.com/dbeaudoinfortin/M2EMavenAARPlugin/tree/main/docs) directory of this Github repository. The easiest way to install the plugin is via the menu option `Help -> Install New Software...`, then clicking the `Add...` button, entering the site `https://dbeaudoinfortin.github.io/M2EMavenAARPlugin/` in the `Location` box and clicking the `Add` button to add a new software installation site.
